              We are a wife and husband team with a small crew of dedicated and dog loving humans. We opened in 2016 and we have proudly serving the Somerset area since. We started for one single reason, to provide dogs that enjoy the company of other dogs and humans the services and care that they need and deserve. 
              </p>
            
              <p class="about-p">
              We absolutely love that the dogs who stay with us are having as much fun on their holiday as their owners are on theirs! Mendip Council recognises our exceptional work and care we provide with a 5 Star License (highest achievement).

            We have two large paddock areas for running, playing and sniffing that total 1/3 of an acres with paddling pools and tunnels. We also have several covered concrete play yards complete with sofa's beds and climbing frames. For rainy days we have a large 65 m2 inside playroom and two smaller inside playrooms which are all equipped with sofa's and beds.

          <p class="align-p">
            Each kennel has underfloor heating with some having an option for covered outdoor space via a dog flap or door. Maximum daylight is provided via glass doors and large double glazed windows, which also provides a quiet environment for your pet. All Kennels are thoroughly cleaned before and after each use. Please feel free to provide a fleece that smell of home for your dogs  and toys if you feel he/she will be happier during their stay (although if they decide to destroy it we won't be able to replace it!).
