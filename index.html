              We are a wife and husband team with a small crew of dedicated and dog loving humans. We opened in 2016 and we have proudly serving the Somerset area since. We started for one single reason, to provide dogs that enjoy the company of other dogs and humans the services and care that they need and deserve. 
              </p>
            
              <p>
              We absolutely love that the dogs who stay with us are having as much fun on their holiday as their owners are on theirs! Mendip Council recognizes our exceptional work and care we provide with a 5 Star License (highest achievement).

            We have two large paddock areas for running, playing and sniffing that total 1/3 of an acres with paddling pools and tunnels. We also have several covered concrete play yards complete with sofa's beds and climbing frames. For rainy days we have a large 65 m2 inside playroom and two smaller inside playrooms which are all equipped with sofa's and beds.

            <p class="align-p">So refreshing to find a "Home from Home" kennel. Winnie has now stayed a couple of times and has been very happy. A little tired on her return, but that's only because she was well exercised. Thank you for looking after her so well. Carol from Wells</p>
