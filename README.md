## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Waggy Tail Lodge Website Colour Palette](docs/colourpalette.png)

The website uses a palette of shades of green, to imitate the grass that the dogs spend alot of time on. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

I have used EB Garamond from Google Fonts for this website. It is a serif font.

![EB Garamond Font](docs/font.png)

### Imagery

All imagery used within the site has been chosen to showcase the Waggy Tail Lodge. I created a new logo for the owners, as they asked for it to have a more modern look. I have credited these at the end.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

## Testing

Testing has been on going throughout the build with Chrome developer tools.

My mentor on our mid project meeting discussed: 
* My image files were to big for the website, so I have resized and croped to the aspect ratio and then optimized them.
* There was problem that some of the images overlapped when checking that pages of the Website were responsive. This issue is documented as 2. under Solved Bugs.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

[Index Page HTML](docs/testing/w3cindex.png) - Passed but had 2 info points and then corrected them on the other pages.

[Our Services Page HTML](docs/testing/w3courservices.png) - 1 error on a stray div. Now deleted.

[Contact & FAQ Page HTML](docs/testing/w3ccontact.png) - 1 error and 1 warning for the google map. This is documented as 3. under Solved Bugs.

[Book Now! Page HTML](docs/testing/w3cindex.png) - Passed

[style.css](docs/testing/w3ccss.png) - 1 error on a property that doesn't exist. Now deleted.

### Solved Bugs
1. The About Us section on the home page was not fitting properly when it was on a medium screen. So I changed the bootstrap grid system to large.
2. The images when on a medium device were overlapping with text. I fixed this by changing the bootstrap grid system from small to medium.
![Responsive Issue](docs/testing/responsiveissue.png) ![Resolved Issue](docs/testing/resolvedissue.png)
3. I had adjusted the Google Maps width to 100% to make the page responsive. The error was the % sign on the iframe code. I have reinserted a new link to Google Maps to clear the error and then put a paragraph aboud the iframe to be able to center the map allowing it to be more responsive. For the warning I just changed the section to a div.

### Known Bugs

On the Chrome developer tool, it comes up with 6 warnings and 24 verbose for the Google Maps link. The 6 warnings are regarding third party cookies will be blocked. The 28 verbose are for "Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive." When researching and looking on slack I was unable to find a solution without using JavaScript. As I don't have any experience so far with JavaScript this is currently unable to implement, but would be able to update it in the future.
