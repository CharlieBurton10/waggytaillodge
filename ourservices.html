              <h4>Day Care for Dogs:</h4>
                <p class="text-center">
                  Our weekday only service offers a unique day care experience for your dogs. Dogs that come to day-care have a busy and fun packed schedule!  During their time with us they have an hour out in their personality-matched group of friends, then have an hour down time in a kennel before they come back out to play and do the whole routine again.  
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">
                  Please note a happy dog is not always a clean dog and that on rainy days, we do our best but often struggle to keep your dogs pristine and clean.  This is inevitable when playing with friends and something to think about when booking your dog in for day-care.  To always keep towels in the car for the journey home is very good advice!

              <h4>Boarding for Dogs:</h4>
                <p class="text-center">
                  Whether you're going away for the weekend or off on your annual summer holiday, our dog boarding facilities are the ideal place to leave your dog. With regular interaction and exercise, you can rest assured that your dog will be well looked after.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">
                  Unlike most dog boarding kennels, our indoor kennels are only for your pet when it's time to go to bed. During the day, we keep your dog active and encourage interaction with our other four legged guests. As with all boarding kennels, all guests must have up to date vaccinations. We do not specify that clients must have the kennel cough vaccination, however if you decide to go ahead with this vaccination, we are unable to accept the dog into day care or boarding for a minimum of two weeks.
